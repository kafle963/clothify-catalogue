# Clothify Catalogue - Comprehensive Optimization Report

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive code review, cleanup, and optimization performed on the Clothify Catalogue application. The focus was on production-readiness, performance optimization, and modern development practices.

## üßπ Code Cleanup & Removal

### Removed Unnecessary Components
- **Duplicate Toast Hook**: Removed redundant `src/components/ui/use-toast.ts` that was duplicating functionality from `src/hooks/use-toast.ts`
- **Duplicate Imports**: Fixed duplicate import statements in `ProductCard.tsx`
- **Console Logs**: Cleaned up verbose console logging in production code while preserving essential error logging:
  - `AuthContext.tsx`: Removed 13+ non-essential console.log statements
  - Kept error logging for debugging production issues

### Debug Code Removal
- All vendor debug components previously removed
- All debug console logs with emojis cleaned up
- Removed verbose development-only logging

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations
